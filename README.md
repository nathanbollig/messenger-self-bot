This toy project is a simple chatbot that supplies responses based on cosine similarity. Two files are required for generating responses.

    chatbot.txt - any plaintext file
    
    responses.pickle - generated by build_dict.py

After supplying these files, run main.py to start the chatbot. Here is a sample response for my chatbot.txt and responses.pickle:

NB: My name is Nathan. I will answer your queries. If you want to exit, type 'bye'!

hello
NB: greetings! except for a hot transistor, the weather's pretty good today!

What is the greatest band on earth?
NB: the greatest band on earth is the beatles.

What sound do you hate?
NB: Well I didn't put it after Yesterday in my fantasy album.

How likely is it that the world will end in the next hundred years?
NB: Well I hope you make it man, but it wouldn't be the worst outcome

Are you joking?
NB: Ok I guess. Kind of just waiting to go to bed haha.

Can you teach mathematics?
NB: I'd have to learn it first.

See you later!
NB: Sure! Don't get eaten by dream zombies

I plan to use this as a way to introduce myself during a lecture, by incorporating my Facebook chat history into the chat bot and including biographical content in chatbot.txt file.
